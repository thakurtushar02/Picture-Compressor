# Picture-Compressor
MATLAB project which takes in as input a picture and outputs that same photo using only the desired number of colours  

Simply put an image in the same folder as the rest of the files, run script file named ConvertImage.m.  

Then type in the full name of the image "example.jpg" when prompted.  

Next type the number of colours you would like in the final creation.  

Add a maximum number of iterations before it forcefully stops (put number > 500 if you don't care about how long it takes)  

Wait 10-15 seconds if it's a large photo.  

Voila!
